# 26quick

Open source for 26quick.com. Project designed to practice data collection, organization, analysis, and visulaization on a medium-sized relational database, facilitating a familiarity with the entire data pipeline as well as a broad understanding of full-stack responsive web development and a few ubiquitous web technologies. Concretely, I'm hoping to draw insights related to learning a simple task with some random variation by repetition, e.g. optimal practice session duration, time of day, optimal mistakes/speed trade-off, etc.
